Apache Hive For Real-Time Queries And Analytics

Introduction: 

Assume that one website is generating log files in real time and the log file contains entries like user A visited page 1, user B visited page 3, user C visited page 2, user D visited page no 4.
and so on. 

How will you implement a Hadoop job for this to answer the following queries in real-time:

1) Which page was visited by user C more than 4 times in a day?

2) Which page was visited by only one user exactly 3 times in a day?
